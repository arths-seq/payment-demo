                <h3>1. What is PayLater?</h3>
                <p>PayLater is a Buy Now Pay Later payment option which lets you purchase goods / services first and pay later. You get 14 days from the date of order fulfillment to settle your bills with us. This service is provided by ePayLater / Arthashastra Fintech. Pvt. Ltd.</p>

                <h3>2. What are the benefits of using PayLater</h3>
                <p>PayLater offers the simplest possible checkout experience in existence today. Using PayLater, you can conclude your transaction with just a click. There is no requirement of punching in your 16-digit card number or having to log in. You can make multiple such single click purchases and make a payment for all of them together anytime at your convenience within 14 days. That’s not all! With PayLater you get a bunch of other benefits as well:
                    <br>
                    <span>a. </span><b> The 14-days period is totally interest free!</b><br>
                    <span>b. </span> By delinking shopping from payments, we eliminate the dependencies on any third-party payment service providers such as payment gateways, banks etc. at the point of transaction thereby providing an unmatched transaction success rate. 
                    <br>
                    <span>c. </span>PayLater not only provides the benefits of COD, such as a seamless checkout service and a pay after delivery option, but also goes beyond by doing away with the hassles associated with handling cash. No more do you need to struggle to find change or worry about your order not getting delivered when you are not around to make the payment.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>3. What do I need to do to use PayLater?</h3>
                <p>If you are a first time user of PayLater then depending on the information provided by you, you may be required to provide certain basic information to help us identify you such as your email id, phone number or a government id. If eligible, you can start transacting using PayLater.</p>

                <h3>4. Why am I not eligible to use PayLater via ePayPartner?</h3>
                <p>We check customer eligibility based on near zero or very limited data provided directly by the user in order to make the customer on-boarding process as frictionless as possible. Hence, there is a possibility that you may not be eligible for ePayLater even though you may have a good credit profile. This is due to the limited information we have on you. </p>

                <h3>5. How can I make the payment for the goods / services purchased?</h3>
                <p>You will receive an intimation of the amount to be paid and the payment due date by email and SMS on the email id and phone number provided at the time of checkout. You can make a payment by clicking on the payment link provided therein.</p>

                <h3>6. What are the payment options using which I can make a payment to PayLater?</h3>
                <p>You can make a payment using net banking, debit card, credit card or through a bank transfer (NEFT/IMPS). We currently do not support settlement of dues by cash.</p>

                <h3>7. Is there a late payment fee?</h3>
                <p>Yes, failure to make a payment within 14 days will entail levying of a penal interest at the rate of 36% per annum for the days that the amount stays overdue and / or a flat late payment fees of Rs. 20.</p>

                <h3>8. Are there any hidden charges that I should be aware of?</h3>
                <p>None at all. We believe in transparency and convenience. There are absolutely no hidden charges.</p>

                <h3>9. Why should I pay back on time?</h3>
                <p>Firstly, as you build your record of prompt repayments your spending limit with ePayLater will keep increasing. Further, timely repayments also help you build a strong credit profile which will help you in availing financial products by banks, lenders and other financial institutions at favourable terms.</p>

                <h3>10. What happens if someone doesn’t pay back?</h3>
                <p>We understand that it is human to miss payment deadlines and overlook reminders. Hence, we give our customers the leeway of a few more days beyond the due date to make the payment. However, the customer will be charged a late payment fees for such period. Users are notified multiple times via email, SMS and phone calls before the due date and periodically thereafter. This is why hardly any user ends up not paying at all. However, in the remote case of non-payment the user’s ePayLater account is deactivated and just like an electricity bill or any utility bill, any amount payable to ePayLater is legally enforceable. Further, ePayLater, acting through its partner financial institutions, holds the right to report all such cases to credit bureaus including CIBIL which may impact your credit rating and hence your ability to access financial products, including any kind of loans, in the future.</p> 

                <h3>11. How do I cancel a transaction or claim a refund?</h3>
                <p>You can contact the merchant directly for any cancellations / returns / refunds. Once your cancellation / return / refund request has been accepted by the merchant we will be notified of the same by the merchant. If you are yet to make a payment to ePayLater for that transaction, we will adjust your payment due as per the refund processed by the merchant. In such a case you would be liable to pay ePayLater only for the the remaining amount outstanding against the transaction. However, in case you have already made the payment to ePayLater for the transaction you will receive the refund amount into the instrument used for making the payment to ePayLater.</p>


                <h3>12. How is my eligibility and spending limit determined?</h3>
                <p>Your eligibility and spending limit is determined based on various parameters including your buying behavior on the merchant, your transaction history with PayLater etc. We at PayLater strive to allow access to our services to as many customers as possible but may not be able to do so in some cases due to various reasons including limited availability of qualifying data. However, we are young and learning and our models are continuously evolving. What this means is, while we may not be able to approve you today there are chances that we may automatically do so in the future. In such a case you will hear back from us.</p>

                <h3>13. Do I need to pay ePayLater in case I cancel the transaction?</h3>
                <p>You continue to be liable to make the payment to ePayLater till such time that we receive a refund request from the merchant. In case you are approaching a payment due date and your refund is yet to be processed we recommend that you make the payment to ePayLater for the amount due to avoid any late payment / penal interest. Once we receive the refund intimation from the merchant we will process the refund to your account.</p>
